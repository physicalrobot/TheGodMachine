** Spring 1939

The room hummed with the soft crackle of radio transmissions, the faint glow of lamps illuminating stacks of coded reports and handwritten notes. Eve Sinclair sat hunched over a desk inside the intelligence monitoring station at Bletchley Park, fingers tracing the familiar rhythms of intercepted Nazi messages. The air smelled of ink and machine oil, the scent of war being waged in silence.

From an early age, Eve had been drawn to the mysteries of language. Raised by an English professor and a former diplomat, she had grown up with ciphers instead of bedtime stories, ancient scripts instead of fairy tales. She had devoured books on cryptography, studied linguistic patterns, and mastered multiple languages by the time she was eighteen. Her fascination with codes deepened as she learned about the cryptographic techniques used in previous wars, including the intricate play between encoded messages and those determined to break them.

When war loomed on the horizon, she was quickly recruited into Allied intelligence. By early 1939, she found herself at Bletchley Park, the nerve center of Britain’s codebreaking efforts. Here, a team of mathematicians, linguists, and analysts worked tirelessly to break the German Enigma cipher, the sophisticated encryption machine used by the Nazi military. The Polish cryptographers had laid the groundwork by developing the Bombe, an electromechanical device designed to decipher Enigma’s rotating cipher settings. British intelligence, with Alan Turing at the forefront, had since improved the machine, accelerating their ability to decode Nazi communications.

Despite these advances, codebreaking was still a game of patience and precision. Analysts like Eve had to identify patterns, repeated phrases, and common military terminology hidden within the encrypted texts. Some breakthroughs came through sheer ingenuity; others from human error on the German side—an operator using predictable key settings or repeating a phrase that could be recognized. Every message cracked was another step in deciphering the Reich’s movements, their strategic ambitions laid bare to the Allied war effort.

Tonight was no different from the many long nights she had spent poring over intercepted transmissions. Most were mundane—a list of supply movements, coded weather reports, or the usual propaganda. But as she filtered through the latest batch of transmissions, a garbled message from the Schwabenland expedition caught her attention.

She frowned, adjusting the dials of the radio receiver, trying to clean up the signal. The message was partially lost in static, distorted by atmospheric interference, but certain words stood out:

“Antarctica… Brahmastra… buried… structure… impossible… energy… secrecy required…”

Her breath caught. This wasn’t the standard survey data or geographical updates that had been coming from the Nazi Antarctic expedition. This was something else—something urgent. The mention of Brahmastra, a term rooted in ancient Vedic texts referring to a divine weapon capable of unimaginable destruction, sent a chill through her. What connection did the Nazis have to this mythological artifact?

Eve quickly transcribed the fragmented message, her mind racing. The Schwabenland had embarked on its Antarctic mission months ago, claiming new territory for Nazi Germany, but this hinted at something unexpected. She knew well enough that the Reich’s scientific endeavors often intertwined with Himmler’s obsession with the occult. The mention of a structure, secrecy, and a reference to the Brahmastra suggested something beyond mere exploration.

She had read the reports detailing how the Germans had mapped vast portions of Antarctica, but this transmission suggested something beyond mere cartographic surveys. If the Nazis were hiding something, and secrecy was explicitly required, this was more than just exploration.

Heart pounding, she rose from her seat and hurried down the dimly lit corridor to the senior intelligence officer’s office. The war room was quiet, but the tension in the air never left. She knocked once before stepping inside, presenting the intercepted message.

“We need to analyze this immediately,” she urged. “This isn’t a standard Nazi expedition report. They’ve found something in Antarctica, and they don’t want anyone to know about it.”

The officer took the report, scanning it with narrowed eyes before nodding. “Good work, Sinclair. I’ll have this sent up the chain. If the Nazis are hiding something, we need to find out what.”

He tapped the page with a finger. “This reference—‘Brahmastra.’ That’s not a German word.”

Eve shook her head. “No, sir. It’s Sanskrit. From ancient Hindu scriptures. It describes a weapon with devastating power.”

The officer’s expression darkened. “We’ll escalate this to American intelligence. The OSS has specialists in Vedic mythology. They’ll know what to make of this.”

** 3 days later...

The first rays of dawn stretched across the horizon, bathing the quiet suburban neighborhood in hues of saffron and gold. Dr. Anirudh Sharma stood on the wooden deck of his home in Berkeley, California, facing the rising sun. Clad in a simple cotton kurta, he moved through the twelve asanas of the Suryanamaskar with practiced grace, each motion flowing into the next like a cosmic dance. His breath was steady, his mind empty, attuned to the rhythm of the universe. This was his daily ritual, a connection to the timeless wisdom that had guided sages for millennia.

As he completed the final pose, he folded his hands together and whispered a quiet mantra before sitting cross-legged on the wooden planks. He closed his eyes, allowing his awareness to sink inward. Thoughts, like fleeting shadows, threatened to intrude—fragments of lectures, unfinished translations, the latest research on Vedic time cycles—but he gently pushed them aside. The breath was his anchor. Slow. Measured. Endless. With each inhale, he expanded beyond the confines of his mortal body; with each exhale, he surrendered to the vast ocean of consciousness.

The rustling of leaves and the distant hum of morning traffic signaled the beginning of another day at the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked as a professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Mythology. He had spent years delving into the ancient scriptures, unraveling the layers of meaning encoded in Sanskrit verses. His parents had moved from India to the United States when he was just three years old, and though he had grown up in America, they had ensured he remained deeply connected to his roots. His father had been an ardent follower of Vedanta, frequently taking him to the Vedanta Society of Northern California in San Francisco. Those experiences had shaped him, instilling a reverence for the ancient texts that he now dedicated his life to studying.

By the time he reached the university, the morning air was filled with the murmurs of students gathering in the grand hall. His lecture hall was a vast chamber lined with wooden desks, filled with eager students, both American and international, fascinated by the depth of knowledge their professor wielded.

“Time,” he began, chalk in hand, “is not a straight path, but a cycle. The Rigveda speaks of four great Yugas: Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali. Just as the sun rises and sets, just as the seasons change, so too does time revolve in an endless dance.”

He moved to the blackboard, sketching a vast circle, dividing it into four quadrants. “We are now in the Kali Yuga—the age of decline. But this too shall pass. Just as destruction is inevitable, so too is renewal. The ancients did not merely speculate about these cycles; they mapped them, measured them, encoded them into astronomical calculations.”

A hand rose from the back of the hall. “Professor Sharma, does this mean that history repeats itself?”

A small smile played on his lips. “Not in the way you might think. It is not mere repetition, but a spiral—patterns recur, but with variations. The echoes of the past shape the present, and the choices of today mold the future.”

The students scribbled notes, captivated by the professor’s insight. But before he could continue, the heavy wooden doors of the lecture hall burst open with a resounding thud.

A hush fell over the room as three men in black suits strode in, their presence an anomaly in this space of learning and tradition. Their Western attire and sharp gazes marked them as men of authority—intelligence agents or perhaps something even more clandestine. The lead agent, a tall, severe-looking man with an angular jaw, locked eyes with Sharma.

“Dr. Anirudh Sharma,” he said, his voice clipped. “You must come with us immediately.”

Murmurs spread through the hall. Sharma frowned. “May I ask what this is regarding?”

The agent stepped closer. “There is no time for explanations. Pack your essentials—you leave with us within the hour.”

Sharma glanced at his students, their faces a mix of curiosity and concern. A part of him knew that whatever this was, it was no ordinary summons. He had spent years deciphering texts, tracing myths back to their origins, but the past had always remained just that—the past. Now, something told him that history itself was reaching for him.

He set the chalk down with deliberate calm. “Very well. I want you all to read up to chapter 4 by yourselves, we will have much to go over when I get back. Consider this an early dismissal."

As he gathered his books and strode out of the hall following the men, he could feel the weight of something far greater than himself pressing down upon him. The cycle of time was turning once more, and he was about to step into its currents.
