The frigid wind howled as Eve Sinclair pulled her coat tighter around herself, stepping up the gangway of the vessel that would take them to New Swabia, the Nazi-claimed territory in Antarctica. The ship, a repurposed military vessel, was a sturdy beast, its steel hull cutting through the Atlantic waters with unwavering purpose. The deck was bustling with crewmen, specialists, and intelligence operatives preparing for the long journey ahead.

Dr. Anirudh Sharma followed closely behind her, his satchel slung over one shoulder, his dark eyes scanning their surroundings with a mix of curiosity and apprehension. He had agreed to this mission, but the weight of what they were pursuing—the very possibility that the Brahmastra might be something real—unsettled him in a way he hadn’t expected.

Eve turned to face him as they reached the upper deck, her lips curving into a smirk. “Not exactly your usual academic field trip, is it, Professor?”

Anirudh exhaled a short chuckle. “No, not quite. Though I must say, I didn’t expect my week to end on a vessel bound for the coldest, most inhospitable place on Earth.”

She leaned against the railing, watching the ocean churn beneath them. “What do you make of all this?” she asked, her voice quieter now. “Do you think there’s any chance what the Nazis are after is real?”

Anirudh hesitated. “The actual Brahmastra existed in texts long before the Mahabharata. Many believe it was merely an allegory for ultimate destruction, a metaphor for the devastating power wielded by the gods.” He turned to meet her gaze. “However, the texts also describe something more tangible. The Astra, unlike traditional weapons, has no fixed shape. It can be invoked through a mantra, even from something as simple as a blade of grass.”

Eve raised an eyebrow. “So you’re telling me that a single word, spoken in the right way, could unleash this thing?”

He nodded. “That is what the texts suggest. The Brahmastra is derived from two words: Brahma, meaning creator, and Astra, meaning weapon. It is said to be so powerful that once initiated, there is no stopping it.”

Eve shivered, and not from the cold. “And if that’s what the Nazis found buried in the ice?”

Anirudh’s lips pressed into a thin line. “Then we may be walking into something far worse than we ever imagined.”

A silence settled between them, the weight of their discussion momentarily eclipsing the roar of the wind and sea. Eve turned away first, gazing out at the vastness of the ocean.

“You know,” she said after a moment, “you’d make a fine philosopher.”

Anirudh chuckled. “I prefer history. Less speculation, more facts.”

Eve smirked. “Oh, I doubt that. You can’t study mythology without a little existential curiosity.”

He tilted his head. “Are you saying I’m a closet existentialist?”

She met his gaze, and for the first time since they’d met, there was something playful in her expression. “I’m saying I’d like to see what else is hidden beneath that composed exterior, Professor.”

Anirudh arched an eyebrow. “I wasn’t aware this mission included psychoanalyzing me.”

“Consider it a bonus,” Eve quipped, turning back to the sea.

He watched her for a moment, her auburn hair whipping in the wind, before shaking his head with a small smile. This woman was unlike anyone he had ever met.

A Time Jump: The Horizon of Antarctica

Days blurred into nights as the ship pressed southward, the cold growing sharper with each passing hour. The closer they drew to Antarctica, the more the reality of their mission settled upon them. They weren’t just chasing a Nazi expedition—they were chasing something that defied history itself.

On the morning of their arrival, Anirudh stood beside Eve on the deck as the icy cliffs of Antarctica loomed into view. The endless white stretched across the horizon, a frozen wasteland that held secrets buried for millennia.

Eve exhaled, her breath a mist in the cold air. “Well, Professor. Looks like we’re about to find out just how much truth there is to myth.”

Anirudh tightened his grip on the railing, eyes fixed on the desolate expanse ahead. “Yes,” he murmured. “And I fear we may not be ready for the answer.”
