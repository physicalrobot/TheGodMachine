* PAST TIMELINE (Dr. Anirudh Sharma’s Story)
  This timeline follows Dr. Sharma and Major Eve Sinclair’s mission to Antarctica during WWII. The Nazis are seeking to harness an ancient, possibly extraterrestrial force hidden beneath the ice.

** Key Themes
   - The intersection of science and mythology—Sharma’s deep knowledge of Vedic texts helps decipher what the Nazis could not.
   - The corruption of power—The Nazis see the monolith as a weapon, but Sharma realizes it’s something far more profound (a reality-altering device? A warning?).
   - The cost of knowledge—This timeline reveals what happened to the monolith, why it was lost or hidden, and how it ultimately affected Sharma.
   - Survival and secrecy—By the end, Sharma and Sinclair barely escape, and the U.S. takes control of the site, burying the truth.

:END:
    - Anirudh clarifies what the Brahmastra is.
    - Playful banter foreshadows relationship.


*** The Puzzle: The Lost Coordinates & The Broken Mantra
**** Context
- Before heading to Antarctica, Himmler retrieved an ancient artifact or text from Germany—perhaps an inscribed stone or a hidden manuscript believed to be from the Indus Valley Civilization.
- The Nazis couldn’t fully decipher it, but they used partial translations to guide their mission to Antarctica.
- Eve and Anirudh find a fragment of this text left behind in a recently abandoned Nazi outpost on Antarctica—a cryptic inscription in an ancient script, possibly Proto-Indo-European or Harappan.

**** The Challenge
- The inscription is in an ancient Harappan script—something that has never been fully translated in modern history.
- The Nazi researchers had already cracked part of it, but their notes are incomplete or misleading.
- Eve’s cryptographic skills are needed to decipher the symbols and patterns.
- Anirudh recognizes key Sanskrit-rooted elements and links the decoded words to a Vedic mantra that describes the Brahmastra’s location or its invocation method.
- The mantra is broken—a crucial part is missing—and they must reconstruct it correctly to reveal the true meaning.

**** How the Puzzle Works
- *Finding the Nazi Notes* – They come across the Nazi expedition’s incomplete translation attempt, but some symbols remain uncracked.
- *Deciphering the Text* – Eve realizes the Nazis used a flawed phonetic approach and she reconfigures the patterns, cracking the missing words.
- *Anirudh Provides Context* – Once Eve solves the coded script, Anirudh recognizes the words in Sanskrit or Vedic hymns, linking them to ancient astronomical alignments or a forgotten ritual.
- *The Final Revelation* – The completed mantra is actually a set of coordinates, hidden within the rhythmic structure of the text.
- *Unlocking the Nazi Location* – The coordinates point to a specific uncharted cave or ice-locked ruin where the Nazis have set up their dig site.

**** How This Works for Character Development
- Eve showcases her expertise in cryptanalysis, showing how ancient languages have patterns similar to encoded messages.
- Anirudh proves his depth of knowledge, recognizing the cultural and philosophical significance of the text, making connections that others would miss.
- This collaboration leads to a moment of mutual admiration, subtly pushing their dynamic forward. Maybe Eve teases him about finally admitting myths have value beyond metaphor.

**** The Payoff
- The Nazis were close to understanding the inscription, but they got a crucial part wrong, leading them off track.
- Eve and Anirudh’s solution puts them ahead of the enemy—but also paints a target on their backs, as the Nazis realize they now hold the key.

**** Optional Add-On
If you want a more thrilling reveal, the inscription might contain a warning, hinting that using the Brahmastra is irreversible—something even the Nazis feared. Maybe Anirudh hesitates after understanding what they’re about to uncover, setting up later conflict.


*** Discovery of the Monolith & Its Power
    - The monolith’s inscriptions match ancient Hindu cosmology and other global myths.
    - It has a device or mechanism that distorts reality (is it an ancient alien construct? A forgotten piece of lost civilization tech?).
    - Sharma realizes that the myths of divine weapons are possibly descriptions of reality-altering technology.

*** The Catastrophe: The Monolith is Sealed
    - The Nazis try to activate the artifact, but something goes wrong.
    - The monolith reacts violently, creating a reality distortion (similar to the modern-day “glitch”).
    - The base collapses, the Nazis are wiped out, and Sharma and Sinclair barely escape.
    - The U.S. secures the site, covering it up under Cold War secrecy.
    - Sharma returns to civilian life, haunted by visions and unanswered questions.

*** Anomalous Relic & Existential Pause

    - While investigating the monolith, Sharma and Sinclair uncover an anomalous relic—a metallic, possibly organic construct that distorts reality, causing time dilation, hallucinations, or glimpses of past civilizations.
    - The relic is covered in ancient Sanskrit-like inscriptions (possibly proto-language, a root of all human tongues).
    - Their research hints that this relic is not of this solar system, leading them to believe humanity’s origins may be elsewhere.
    - The monolith contains encoded data—star maps, records of Mars, and warnings about an extinction-level event.

*** Lost Tapes & The Mars Revelation

    - They document their findings in recordings, intended for their respective governments.
    - The tapes detail their theory: humans did not originate on Earth but were a remnant of an intergalactic civilization that sought refuge on Mars before Earth.
    - They deduce that Mars was an “Alpha Home” but collapsed due to internal war, and Earth was seeded as a “Beta Home.”
    - The original colonizers left Earth as a genetic backup, never to return—possibly due to complete annihilation.
    - The classified tapes that remain in government hands only hint at the monolith’s function but omit the Mars connection.
    - The "Lost Tapes," hidden separately, contain the full truth but were presumed destroyed in an intelligence purge.

* PRESENT TIMELINE (Vikram Sharma’s Story)
  Vikram is a physicist who stumbles upon an anomaly in quantum physics, leading him to question the nature of reality. The deeper he digs, the more he realizes his grandfather’s past holds the key.

** Key Themes
   - Scientific discovery meets ancient wisdom—Vikram thinks in terms of quantum physics, but his discoveries align with his grandfather’s research on mythology.
   - The illusion of reality—As he investigates the glitch, he starts experiencing hallucinations, déjà vu, and visions from the past.
   - The simulation theory unfolds—He begins to suspect the universe itself is a construct, and the monolith in Antarctica is a piece of its underlying framework.

** Key Plot Points (Present)
*** Vikram Discovers the Glitch
    - Working at CERN or a similar high-tech lab, he notices a quantum event that defies physics.
    - A particle disappears, as if it never existed. When he runs simulations, they keep returning impossible results.
    - He finds strange mathematical patterns matching ancient symbols (hinting at the monolith’s connection).

*** The Family Connection
    - Researching further, he finds his grandfather’s classified records from WWII.
    - Old photos, documents, and even some strange journal entries suggest that Dr. Sharma witnessed something beyond human understanding.
    - The same symbols found in the monolith appear in Vikram’s quantum data.

*** Reality Starts to Unravel
    - Vikram experiences weird time loops, hallucinations, and altered memories.
    - His experiments reveal glitches in reality, similar to what the monolith caused in the past.
    - He suspects that the artifact is still influencing the world—perhaps buried in Antarctica or hidden by the government.

*** Journey to Antarctica
    - Vikram is now convinced that his grandfather wasn’t just studying mythology—he was trying to warn the world about something.
    - He retraces his grandfather’s steps and heads to Antarctica to uncover the truth.
    - The same location where the Nazis and his grandfather once stood is now a secret military base.
    - What he finds changes everything.

*** Vikram’s Anomaly Leads to the Lost Tapes

    - While conducting an experiment (perhaps quantum entanglement or dark matter research), Vikram’s equipment picks up an interference pattern with an encoded message.
    - He follows this distortion, leading him to a classified NSA storage facility where he uncovers some known tapes from Sharma and Sinclair.
    - The “official” tapes document Antarctica, but Vikram realizes the message feels incomplete.

*** The Uncovering of the Lost Tapes

    - Vikram digs deeper into government archives, tracking inconsistencies.
    - Through old informants, black-market data exchanges, or even hacking attempts, he stumbles upon the lost recordings.
    - The lost tapes reveal the truth about Mars, the ancient war, and the missing colonizers.

*** What Were They Running From?

    - The recordings end with Sharma and Sinclair expressing existential terror—the ancient texts mention a “Cycle of Annihilation.”
    - They suggest that every time humanity reaches a certain technological or philosophical threshold, something intervenes.
    - Were the ancients wiped out by an external force? A cosmic predator? A law of the universe?
    - Vikram begins to experience more anomalies, possibly indicating that by rediscovering this knowledge, he has reactivated something.

*** Key Questions for the Next Steps

**** What Happened to Mars?

    - Did the ancient civilization destroy itself? Or was there an external force?
    - What remnants exist on Mars that could corroborate the lost tapes?

**** How Does Vikram’s Discovery Affect the Present?

    - Does his experiment reactivate something?
    - Does the revelation lead to a global crisis? (E.g., governments rush to cover up or exploit the truth.)

**** Who Wants to Suppress the Truth?

    - Are there modern factions (NSA, CIA, private organizations) still working to keep this hidden?
    - Are there other groups aware of this knowledge but with different intentions?


* HOW THE TIMELINES INTERCONNECT
** The Monolith’s Influence Over Time
   - The past timeline shows the first encounter with the monolith, while the present timeline reveals its ongoing effect on reality.
   - The monolith could be warping time itself, causing historical events to loop or bleed into each other.

** Echoes of the Past in the Present
   - Vikram’s visions, déjà vu, and quantum anomalies are caused by the monolith’s lingering influence.
   - He sees glimpses of his grandfather’s expedition—sometimes memories shift and rewrite themselves.

** The Artifact’s Ultimate Purpose
   - Was it a weapon? A failsafe? A piece of an ancient simulation?
   - The climax will reveal the true nature of the monolith and what it means for reality itself.
