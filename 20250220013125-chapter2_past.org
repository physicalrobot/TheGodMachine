Part 1: Arrival in Washington

March 1939

The plane jolted as it touched down at Washington’s Bolling Field, its wheels skidding slightly on the tarmac before rolling to a smooth halt. Dr. Anirudh Sharma exhaled, rubbing his temples. The journey from Berkeley had been a whirlwind—summoned mid-lecture, given a curt explanation, and bundled onto a military transport with no further details. Now, as he followed the two men in dark suits through the narrow terminal, he realized he likely wouldn’t be returning to his classroom anytime soon.

He adjusted his satchel, filled with hastily packed notes and research materials. The sun had set, leaving only the distant glow of city lights outside the terminal windows. He barely had time to process the situation before he was ushered into a waiting car, its windows tinted and its driver silent.

As the vehicle wove through the streets of Washington, he studied the men seated on either side of him. They had the air of intelligence officers—stern, unreadable, and efficient. Finally, unable to keep his curiosity contained, he asked, “Are you going to tell me why I’m here, or do I have to start guessing?”

Neither man responded immediately. The one in the passenger seat finally turned to him. “You’ll be briefed soon, Dr. Sharma.”

Part 2: The Meeting

The car stopped outside an unmarked building in the heart of the capital. Anirudh was led inside, down a series of dimly lit hallways, and into a room barely illuminated by a single overhead lamp. The air smelled faintly of tobacco and old paper.

At the far end of the table sat a man in military uniform, his posture rigid. Beside him was a woman, her auburn hair pinned neatly back, her piercing gaze studying him intently.

“Dr. Sharma,” the officer began, gesturing toward a chair. “Please, have a seat.”

Anirudh complied, setting his satchel down beside him. “I assume you’re not just interested in my Sanskrit expertise for an academic debate.”

The woman smirked. “No, professor. We have something much more pressing.”

She slid a folder across the table toward him. He opened it, flipping through the contents. The first few pages detailed Nazi excavation reports, vague descriptions of artifacts, and coordinates in Antarctica. Then he found it—a reference to Brahmastra. His brow furrowed.

“This is… impossible,” he muttered. “Where did this come from?”

“An intercepted transmission from a German expedition in Antarctica,” she replied. “They’ve found something buried beneath the ice. Something they weren’t expecting.”

Anirudh inhaled sharply, staring at the name. The Brahmastra, a mythological weapon of cosmic destruction, was described in the Mahabharata—but always in metaphorical terms, a symbol of ultimate power, not something that could exist in the real world.

He frowned, closing the folder. “And you take this reference seriously?”

The officer’s expression didn’t change. “Given what the Nazis are searching for, we don’t have the luxury of dismissing anything.”

Anirudh leaned back, crossing his arms. “With all due respect, I’m an academic. If this is code for some military project, I fail to see why you need me and not one of your own analysts.”

Eve, who had been silent so far, cleared her throat. “I understand your skepticism, professor. I’m somewhat familiar with Vedic myths, but only at a surface level. I know my way around Greek and Roman epics too—general knowledge of the classics comes in handy when deciphering codes, passwords, and ciphers. But this?” She tapped the file. “This goes beyond that. Heinrich Himmler and the Nazis aren’t just dabbling in myths; they’ve been obsessing over them. They’ve dedicated an entire division—the Ahnenerbe—to unearthing ancient texts, scouring the world for artifacts, and reconstructing lost knowledge. They aren’t looking for stories; they’re looking for something real.”

Anirudh hesitated. He had read about the Nazi interest in occultism, but he had dismissed it as mere propaganda, political theatrics to give their ideology some grand historical weight. But if they had gone this far—if they truly believed they had found something connected to the Brahmastra—then what exactly had they uncovered?

The officer leaned forward, his voice calm but firm. “We need to understand what they’ve found, Dr. Sharma. If they’re right—if there’s even a shred of truth to this—then we need to stop them before they weaponize it.”

Silence filled the room, stretching out between them.

Anirudh exhaled slowly, the weight of the situation pressing down on him. He had spent his life buried in texts, unearthing the past. Now, it seemed, history was reaching out for him.

Finally, he nodded. “I’m in.”
