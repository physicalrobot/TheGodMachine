* The Seeds of Obsession
** Setting
- Early 1938 Berlin and remote locations worldwide

** Overview
- Introduce Heinrich Himmler and his occult-focused team in the Nazi regime.
- Their obsession with ancient mysticism and the potential for re-engineering lost technologies leads to secret expeditions around the world.

** Key Scene
- Himmler receives ancient relics plundered from the Himalayas, including a star map carved into stone.
- Nazi archaeologists decode the map, interpreting it as a guide to the “Brahmastra,” an ancient weapon or object of unimaginable power.

** Historical Accuracy
- Rooted in the historical Nazi fascination with Aryan mythology, occultism, and the Himalayan expeditions funded by the Ahnenerbe (the Nazi research institute).

** Foreshadowing
- The star map vaguely indicates a location far to the south, which will later be pinpointed as Antarctica.

* The Chamber of Secrets

** 1938

The air in the dimly lit chamber was heavy with the scent of aged parchment and dust, punctuated by the faint metallic tang of candle wax. Shelves groaned under the weight of tomes bound in cracked leather, their spines adorned with cryptic symbols and titles long erased from memory. Pagan idols loomed from shadowed alcoves, their cold, unblinking stares reflecting the flicker of the candelabras. This was his sanctum—a hidden library nestled deep within the heart of Berlin, stocked with artifacts and writings deemed heretical by the church and lunacy by academia.

At the center of the room, Heinrich Himmler leaned over a mahogany table scarred by centuries of use. His thin, gloved fingers traced the intricate lines of a freshly acquired relic—a weathered stone tablet etched with Sanskrit verses whispering of divine weapons and forgotten epochs. Behind him, members of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi research institute for ancient studies, stood at attention, awaiting his orders like priests before their deity. The Reich had launched expeditions to the farthest reaches of the world—Tibet, Egypt, and Mesopotamia—an endeavor that now seemed to be bearing fruit.

*** A Revelation
- “This,” Himmler whispered, his voice tinged with reverence and hunger, “is no mere artifact. It is a revelation.”
- His pale eyes glinted as he turned to his advisors, lifting the tablet toward the light.
- “The Aryan race, our progenitors, were destined to wield powers beyond imagination. Their secrets were scattered, hidden, but not lost.”

One of the men stepped forward, holding a thick dossier detailing the tablet’s origins—smuggled out of a Himalayan monastery after months of clandestine excavation. A map carved into the back of the tablet, decoded by a team of archaeologists and occultists, pointed vaguely south—an unthinkable location far from civilization. Yet to Himmler, it was destiny, a chance to reshape the Reich’s waning fortunes. Beneath the brittle light of the occult library, the seeds of an obsession took root, setting the stage for horrors that would transcend the battlefield.

Himmler’s lip curled in satisfaction. As the war edged closer to desperation, the pursuit of ancient mysticism was no longer merely a passion—it was an obsession. The relic, he believed, held the key to a weapon older than history, a force that would ensure Germany’s dominion over the world. His advisors spoke of the Brahmastra, an ancient weapon of cosmic devastation, described in texts like the Mahabharata as capable of wiping out entire cities.

It wasn't much to go off, but this was all they had left.

*** The Silence Before the Storm
- The silence in the chamber was absolute, save for the rhythmic drip of melting wax pooling onto the wooden table.
- Himmler traced his gloved fingers along the tablet’s surface, his pale eyes alight with something that bordered on religious fervor.
- The ancient stone, cool and unyielding beneath his touch, bore secrets long buried by time and forgotten by the weak.

“This,” he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper, “is no mere artifact.”

The assembled officers of the Ahnenerbe shifted uneasily. The flickering candlelight cast long shadows, stretching their forms into distorted silhouettes against the cracked walls of the library. Books bound in human skin—so legend whispered—lined the shelves, their spines inscribed with glyphs that defied translation. Pagan effigies and forbidden idols loomed in the dim recesses of the room, silent witnesses to history’s darkest conspiracies.

One of the scholars, a frail man with spectacles perched on the bridge of his narrow nose, stepped forward, clutching a dossier.

“Herr Reichsführer,” he hesitated, then pressed on, “the inscriptions on the reverse of the tablet... They do not merely speak of power. There is a warning. A guardian, bound to the weapon.”

Himmler’s lips curled, amused.

“A child’s fable.”

He lifted the stone, tilting it toward the light, his fingers tracing the deep grooves where the carving of the star map lay. The etchings resembled constellations, but there was something else, something deeper—an order to the chaos, an underlying structure that spoke to a knowledge lost to the modern world.

Dr. Krauss, one of the more outspoken occultists in Himmler’s inner circle, swallowed hard.

“The monks who guarded this… they believed it could not be wielded by men alone. That it was placed beyond reach for a reason. The stories of it's origins go far back into the last ice age, it's a mircale alone that it has survived this long.”

“Then it is ours to reclaim,” Himmler said, his voice hard with conviction. “Destiny does not reward the hesitant.”

The chamber seemed to exhale, the candlelight dimming for the briefest of moments. The men exchanged glances. A draft, perhaps. The Berlin underground was riddled with tunnels, many of them old, forgotten. And yet, something gnawed at the edges of their rational minds—a feeling of being watched, scrutinized, weighed and found wanting.

Himmler lowered the stone back onto the table, his fingers lingering on its surface. A sudden chill licked at the back of his neck, and from somewhere deep within the corridors beyond, a single candle sputtered out.

For a moment, in the shadows that pooled at the library’s edges, something shifted.

Then all was still.

Himmler exhaled through his nose, unshaken.

*** Orders Given
- “Send word to Antarctica.”

Krauss hesitated.

“But we have no precise location—”

“We will,” Himmler cut him off. “We have what we need. The Reich does not wait.”

And as his men hurried to obey, none noticed the hairline fracture that had begun to form in the stone tablet’s surface. A crack, small and imperceptible, yet growing.
